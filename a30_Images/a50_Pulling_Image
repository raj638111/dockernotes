# Examples
  1. docker image pull redis:latest
    + 'latest' do not mean they are the latest #4.77
  2. docker image pull alpine
    + If no tag name is specified, docker will assume the tag name as 'latest' #4.77
    
# Pulling from Docker Hub unofficial registry
  + Just prepend repository name with user name
  + Ex: docker image pull nigelpoulton/tu-demo:v2 #4.78
  
# Pulling from 3rd party registries #4.78
  + Prepend repository name with DNS name
  + Ex: docker pull gcr.io/nigelpoulton/tu-demo:v2 (From Google Container Registry)
  
# Pull all images from a repository #4.78
  + Use -a flag
  + docker image pull -a nigelpoulton/tu-demo
  + Note:
    - If a repository contains Images for multiple architecture and platforms, it will likely fail #4.78
